## User Story

AS AN aspiring developer
I WANT to take a tech quiz
SO THAT I can test my knowledge and improve my skills

## Description: MERN stack, React, MongoDB, and Node.js/Express.js server and API
This week task is to take the starter codebase of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhance it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. This Tech Quiz allows users to answer a series of questions and provides a final score based on the number of correct answers. The project also includes a Cypress folder containing automated test scripts that verify the game's functionality, which can be executed using Cypress or directly from the terminal.

To complete the assignment, you'll need to do the following:

Install Cypress as a dev dependency.

Configure Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing.

Create a component test for the quiz component.

Create an end-to-test for the quiz component..

## Installation
To complete the assignment, you'll need to do the following:

Install `Cypress as a dev dependency.`

Configure `Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing`

Create a component test for the quiz component.

Create an end-to-test for the quiz component.
 
## Usage
While server is running, utilize Insomnia, MongoDBCompass or similar program which can simulate API calls. Use the appropriate routes listed in the routes code.

## Credits
Initial StarterCode was provided by the edX. My task is to use the starter codebase of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhance it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score. The Converting codes were written by me with assistance from various AI chatbots, including Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot. I also watched a lot of Youtube tutorials when troubleshooting issues. Additionally, several YouTube tutorials were referenced to better understand API structure as well.
