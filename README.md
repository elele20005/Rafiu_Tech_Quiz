## Installation
Ensure Node.js is installed. Download or clone the repo. Use `npm i` to install the dependencies needed for the project. Use `npm run build` to build the app. Use `npm start` or `npm run dev` to run the server.
 
## Usage
While server is running, utilize Insomnia, MongoDBCompass or similar program which can simulate API calls. Use the appropriate routes listed in the routes code.

## Credits
All code was written by me with assistance from various AI chatbots, including Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot. I also wathed a lot of Youtube tutorials when troubleshooting issues with Insomnia. Additionally, several YouTube tutorials were referenced to better understand API structure as well.
